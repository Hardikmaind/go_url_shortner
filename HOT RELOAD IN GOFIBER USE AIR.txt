How can i use live reload ?
Air is a handy tool that automatically restarts your Go applications whenever the source code changes, making your development process faster and more efficient.

To use Air in a Fiber project, follow these steps:

Install Air by downloading the appropriate binary for your operating system from the GitHub release page or by building the tool directly from source.
Create a configuration file for Air in your project directory. This file can be named, for example, .air.toml or air.conf. Here's a sample configuration file that works with Fiber:
# .air.toml
root = "."
tmp_dir = "tmp"
[build]
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
  bin = "./tmp/main"
  delay = 1000 # ms
  exclude_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor"]
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
  exclude_regex = ["_test\\.go"]

Start your Fiber application using Air by running the following command in the terminal:
air

As you make changes to your source code, Air will detect them and automatically restart the application.

A complete example demonstrating the use of Air with Fiber can be found in the Fiber Recipes repository. This example shows how to configure and use Air in a Fiber project to create an efficient development environment.
